# My-Curiosity-Rover

For the project work have been taken as a source of inspiration the recent NASA space missions Curiosity and Perseverance which have as their primary objective the search for traces of water within Martian soil and rock samples. The project, in fact, is a two-dimensional simulation of a rover whose primary objective is to explore and analyze r rocks distributed in a portion of Martian territory m Ã— n with total area A. It is assumed that the rover has mapped a series of rocks in a Martian plain and autonomously goes to analyze them one by one to find traces of water.
Once in the proximity of a rock the rover analyzes it and if it finds traces of water it collects the sample and continue on its way to the next rock. Once finished the analysis of all the rocks, the rover must bring the samples to its base located in the center of the map at coordinates (0, 0).
